# Approach #06

If you need some information to be returned when something will go wrong.

## Pros
* Clear contract - possible two results
* Can return proper result object if everything is OK...
* ... or information about failure if something has gone wrong
* the caller will decide what to do with the result
* in the functional way

## Cons
* _Just purely functional languages uses that_ - (still kidding)
* do not use if you do not need additional information or detailed response
